# Double-Linked-List

## Overview:

- This project demonstrates the implementation of a doubly linked list in the C programming language. A linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and references (links) to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node has pointers to both its next and previous nodes, forming a bidirectional chain.

- The key feature of a doubly linked list is the ability to traverse the list in both forward and reverse directions, offering increased flexibility and functionality compared to a single linked list.

## Features:

- Insert nodes at the beginning and end of the linked list.
- Insert nodes after and before a specific position.
- Delete nodes from the beginning, end, and a specific position.
- Display all nodes in both forward and reverse order.
